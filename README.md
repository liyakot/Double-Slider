### Description
___
The mini-project is a picture slider. Only 4 pictures with, beautiful captions.

It can be a useful addition to any site, for example, to display a assortment of products :sparkles:

The project is created with native JS and CSS, without any frameworks and libraries.

### How it works

When you click on the arrow, the picture and caption change, moving in opposite directions. Also, for devices with a screen width of less than 535px, the slider becomes horizontal.
